# rpgsh

`rpgsh` is an interactive and extensible shell purpose-built for table-top RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons©, Pathfinder©, and more!

## Disclaimer

This project is entirely developed independantly. I am not associated in anyway with Wizards of the Coast, Paizo, or any other company. To any lawyers eyeing me up, I will not be adding information that would negate the need for players to puchase your products (e.g. spell descriptions).

## Install

Run `sudo ./install.sh; ./install.sh`

## How to Use

Once the project is installed, run the program with the `rpgsh` command.

See `docs/rpgsh-userguide.pdf` for detailed instructions on how everything works.

## Programming Third-Party Applications

**WIP**
See `docs/rpgsh-programmingguide.pdf` for full details.
